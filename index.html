<h1>Role:</h1>
At FactoryU, Scotiabank Digital Factory’s newest research and experiment centre in Waterloo, ON, I was one of four co-op students on the Winter 2018 team. Being the very first group of students to experience the innovative space, it was a term full of learning. My role as the Design co-op was to tackle all things design on our four-month long project, whether it was visual design, or customer experience. 
<br><br>
At FactoryU, we focus on being forward-thinkers of the banking industry, working on products that might come to fruition later into the future. That being said, I was able to experience a problem from it’s definition stage to a prototype’s testing stage through and Agile workflow. Though the product is not shipped, we were able to propose the idea and showcase our prototype to the entire Digital Factory team. 
<br><br><br>


<h1>Problem Space:</h1>

<img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/8b17fcf9e57333fa71579fbbb48a9b26/tumblr_p6za0uwNYf1uhu4zwo4_r1_1280.png" height="100%" width="100%">

Scotiabank Digital Banking Unit’s mission statement is to <b>make sure our customers are more well off</b>. A certain level of financial literacy is essential to ensuring a person can make wise decisions on their money, whether it is as short term as a shopping splurge or as long term as an investment - thus becoming more well off. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, nearly six of 10 Canadians failed a basic financial literacy put on by lowestrates.ca (<a href="http://lowestrates.ca">Source</a>), whereas the same portion of Canadian’s consider themselves financially literate. That doesn’t sound right. The information is out there, so why aren’t people accessing it?
<br><br>
<b>So, how might we improve our customers' financial literacy?</b>
<br><br><br>


<h1>User Research:</h1>
Because of our relationship with the University of Waterloo and close vicinity to the three major post-secondary schools in the Kitchener Waterloo area. Using open ended questions to reduce bias and a large and diverse sample of surveyees, we stepped outside our hub to gether some insights from the public student population. After hearing stories upon stories, we came back and jotted down every point anyone brought up onto the walls and categorized them into topics - ranging from people’s primary information source, to their perspective on banks - whether positive or cynical. Through this research, we came up with three major insights.


<br><br>
<div class= "row">
    <div class="col-4"><u>Insight #1:</u><br> Most students in this group do not proactively seek out information on their financial problems, either failing to recognize they have any problems or feeling their primary resource was sufficient.</div>
    <div class="col-4"> <u>Insight #2:</u><br> The primary currency in determining who they trust for information appears to be an emotional connection and innate trust in the resource (be it family, professional, or on the internet).</div>
    <div class="col-4"><u>Insight #3:</u><br> Most students do not spend long investigating their financial concerns, and jargon in any source to be discouraging, so the information needs to easily fit with their needs and be easy to find and understand.</div>
</div>

<br><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/24b2f572eca2e39020ffe22974d91160/tumblr_p6za0uwNYf1uhu4zwo7_r2_400.gif" align="right" height="20%" width="20%" style="margin:5% 0% 5% 5%"><br>
But the most prominent pattern we saw was that people were  uncomfortable when talking about money, even when it was as simple as their budgeting habits. <b>Money is taboo.</b> <br><br>
We didn’t need to provide more accessible information, because nobody was going to look for it even if it was right in front of their eyes. we needed to foster a <i>culture change</i>, that both customers and banks can get behind. 

<br><br><br>



<h1>Ideation:</h1>

From social media hashtags to augmented reality powered goal setting, we brainstormed products and services that would answer our “How Might We”s. After reiterating our goal of creating a cultural shift, we knew we needed to create something that empowered our customers. 
<br><br>


<b>Introducing: Grasp</b>
<br><br>
Grasp is a platform where students can ask difficult questions about their finances to a broad and secure community to receive the right answers fast.
<br><br>
With our key goal being creating a culture shift in the topic of money, we decided to create a collaboration heavy community for financial information. We chose to target the student population due to because of the time period’s identity of growth and change.
<br><br>
The key function of Grasp was the ability for users to ask pressing questions and get their answers fast. A pattern we noticed from our user research was that students’ currency in determining their trust for financial information was an emotional connection and an innate trust, be it their family, friends, professional, or the internet. By building the Grasp platform around unbiased, white labeled information and secure identities, we pull the benefits of a diverse set of answers at the same time we build trust. 
<br><br><br>


<h1>Prototyping:</h1>

The first step to building out Grasp was to determine the functions that would help us meet our mission. We determined that there must be

- the ability to see content

- the ability to post content

- the ability to save content

- the ability to credit content

For user to trust information, there must be a way to see its credibility, and in order for information to have credibility, users must interact with it.

With these user stories in place, I began to sketch a workflow of how a user might step through screens. 

Because of our structure, we stuck with a very specific and focused user story and scenario. With one screen per page, I sprawled the flow across the tables, bringing in teammates for feedback ever so often. At the roughest stage, the screens were boxes and crooked lines, but this made iteration super easy. Screens were replaced by the minute, and the steps became clearer and clearer. I snapped photos of the screens and imported them into InVision for a very rough wireframe.

<img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/9f11c7296886e3ef827c7e8d8a3e06d0/tumblr_p6za0uwNYf1uhu4zwo10_r1_1280.png" height="100%" width="100%" style="margin 5% 0% 5% 0%">
<br><br><br>

<h1>Design and Development:</h1>

With the flow finalized, it was time to add in elements that would compliment the experience. I put down my product designer cap, and put on my UI designer tiara. 

<img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/664e44bccedd048e5d07b87d37126683/tumblr_p771jhplWh1uhu4zwo1_1280.png" height="100%" width="100%" style="margin: 5% 0% 5% 0%">

To white label Grasp, we stood far far away from any of the major banking colours, and stuck with gold. However, with that scheme, we ran into some accessibility issues, and toggled around with opacity and size to create an mobile optimized interface. While my teammates were waist deep in databases and ReactJS code, I fed them element after element, palette after palette, to create the pixel perfect MVP (minimum viable product). I also meddled around with the front-end component code and CSS styling using SASS.

we present.


<br><br><br>
<h1>What’s next?</h1>

Integrating a bank-backed rewards system, logistics and legal need to be involved with the project. Though it is a budding idea with backed-up tech, we planted the seed in Scotiabank for the potential future of customer financial literacy.

<h1>Step 1: Existentialism</h1>
<i>Who am I? Why am doing this? Why am I here?</i> <br><br>These questions are essential in two situations: philosophical discussions, and self-branding. Creating a professional identity means forming a visual persona that will hopefully stand out in a sea of applications, and y'know, having a <i>really cool logo</i>. So, like any good user researcher, I asked a random sample of friends to describe me in 5 words. The answers touched from creative and witty, to curious and embarassing, but almost everyone I asked included variations of the words "bold", "headstrong", or "vibrant". 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Step 2: Laying it Out</h1>
I'm willing to bet you 10 bucks that if you bump into me one day, I'll be wearing at least one of three primary colours. So color palette was one of the easiest things to determine. I needed a bright color (yellow), a base color (blue), and a darker accent (navy). I played around on the colour wheel, and the scheme was born.
<br><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/4414fac2f7844031615bd9a9ae16a9d0/tumblr_p5ub1fB6Px1t3a0hzo1_1280.jpg"alt="layout" height="60%" width="60%" align="left" style="margin:5% 5% 5% 0%"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/66a1fb58c674255450e92afb7416ebb6/tumblr_p5ozstgbu31t3a0hzo10_1280.png"alt="layout" height="30%" width="30%" align="right" style="margin:5% 0% 5% 5%"><br>
I sketched a couple of ideas of layouts, determining what is most important to put out to the world. Originally, my <a href="http://queeniwu.tumblr.com" target="_blank">art blog</a> was my professional website. But since it organized content by time rather than relevancy, I was hesitant to upload new work in fear that it would hide older but better posts. From there, I dragged and dropped shapes into Sketch, utilizing my free few weeks of the wonderful prototyping tool <br> There were a couple of major design decisions I had made at that point: <br><br>
<ul>1. Single Page: Putting all information on one page reduces the number of actions for someone to navigate and explore the page. Extra information is linked out of the website, and will open in a new tab to reduce navigation. </ul>
<ul>2. Fixed Navigation Bar: With navigation in mind, there must be a way for someone to jump to certain information when relevant. I knew that the two biggest pieces of information needed would be my skillset and projects, and my personality, both of which should be accessible by links that went to their own sections.  </ul>
<ul>3. Greeting: This websites showcases my work, my experiences, my interests, but most importantly, it showcases me, Queenie Wu. I wanted to add a personable greeting to set the environment for the rest of my work and back it up with a human touch. </ul>
<ul>4. I removed the header image as the title and greeting made it seem like to separate landing pages with no additional information, causing someone to have to scroll further than they need. </ul>
<ul>5. With the overly white theme, I changed the navigation background to be blue to create contrast, as well as the contact background to indicate the end of the page.</ul>
<ul>6. The "about" and "project" sections switched spots numerous times. I didn't know whether I wanted to highlight my work first, or myself. But because of the strong identity I present with the bold colours, I wanted my technical skills to be of substance after the hook. </ul>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Step 3: Logo </h1><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/80dcac494280f83259577bcf50c0919c/tumblr_p5ozstgbu31t3a0hzo7_r1_1280.jpg"alt="layout" height="40%" width="40%" align="right" style="margin:0% 0% 0% 5%">
This is the part where I find out that creating a logo isn't just slapping a single graphic onto a business card, it was curating an image that I needed to identify with. It will become the forefront of my brand.<br><br> 

My initials are very unique. It's pretty obvious that 'Queenie' is never going to appear on a souvenir keychain, but sometimes they don't even make anything in the letter 'Q'. Another thing I wanted to play off of was my list of adjectives. I may be bold in both colour and words, but what about in font-weight? <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/6cb1647a6f2bd54e40b1cfeb9fdd74f1/tumblr_p5ozstgbu31t3a0hzo4_1280.png"alt="sketchideas" height="40%" width="40%" align="right" style="margin:5% 0% 2.5% 5%">I took all these ideas and went to the drawing board and scribbled out some Qs. I played with color, style, uppercase, lowercase, cursive, and block. Then, comes along Sketch, and I have some rough ideas to put out there. At this point I didn't know what I thought about the first, I loved the lowercase Q as it resembled my signiature, despised the third, iterated on the fourth, and overcomplicated the last. I wanted to see the potential of the first, and thus created too many more iterations. <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/ac9b3f843d3a9eedf2581195d5c6a96d/tumblr_p5ozstgbu31t3a0hzo5_1280.png"alt="layout" height="40%" width="40%" align="right" style="margin:2.5% 0% 5% 5%"> I had a bit of fun with colour, line, and perspective. I wanted to highlight the fact that it was a bolded Q by placing yellow on spots of shadow, and created a "fenced" version, that to be honest, looked pretty cool! I liked where this was going and I wanted some opinions.  This is where all designers know your ideas do an entire 180 degree turn. <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/3a638186c4eeb6799a3330258cffe901/tumblr_p5ozstgbu31t3a0hzo6_1280.jpg"alt="layout" height="40%" width="40%" align="left" style="margin:5% 5% 5% 0%"> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> 

I sent photos to a couple of friends to get some feedback, and I felt like I was blind the whole time. It was so obvious! All the Qs looked like speech bubbles! People had a difficult time figuring out what the logo meant, <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/bf40bf6d679f6c4d970505f3d960decf/tumblr_p5ozstgbu31t3a0hzo1_1280.png"alt="layout" height="40%" width="40%" align="left" style="margin:0% 5% 0% 0%">and it wasn't until I told them did they hit the epiphany that it was a Q. <br><br>

I didn't design a logo for myself. <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/472846108d48032967df74b416d5fc13/tumblr_p61n81kjj31t3a0hzo2_1280.png"alt="layout" height="40%" width="40%" align="left" style="margin:5% 5% 5% 0%">I designed one to stand out to other people. I looked at the opportunities to make it better. I could stand the Q up a little, highlight the front, create a hole... I dragged vectors here and there to try and fix certain perspectives without compromising its unique value. Some characteristics were dropped to make way for readability. Finally, with another round of questioning and re-iterating, I felt much more confident. It felt like I was the producer of a week long reality TV show with eliminations of contestants here, there, everywhere. This was the final version of my personal logo that had developed from the pen and pencil sketches just 24 hours ago. I liked it. I was ready to put it on my site.<br><br> 

But I have no site.<br><br><br>



<h1>Step 4: Development</h1>
Here comes the part I was dreading a little bit. Development, front-end, back-end, or web, have never been my strong suits. Nor did I have the drive to go back and learn from mistakes as I do with design. Nonetheless, the idea of having the ability to physically build the things I research and design was a goal I wanted to achieve. <br><br> 

I had a tumblr blog since the age of 11, and I had played around with themes to best display the high quality photos of One Direction, but "href" and "div id" still didn't really make sense to me. My biggest acheivement was moving the sidebar 50 pixels up to make space for bigger posts. Knowing my own knowlege base, I did what every web developer would do: <i>trial and error</i>. I still stuck with developing on Tumblr (rookie platform, I know) becuase I was familiar with the interface, and the ability to host multiple pages so easily and have all the images uploaded was something that I found very convenient. <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/9be22e236c5c11079e398c42205b8923/tumblr_p5w6jxJuqA1uhu4zwo1_1280.gif" alt="dev" height="50%" width="50%" align="right" style="margin: 5% 0% 5% 5%"> <br><br>

Aside from Tumblr and W3 Schools, one tool that I started using before writing my own code was <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a>. It was essentially a code heavier version of Wix. You created your own layouts by dragging and dropping, but you are able to export the code with a fee, or host it through webflow. Experiementing with the functions helped me learn exactly what a div, containter, margins, and padding are. Reading about how to write HTML5/CSS is one thing, but implementation is another. You can check out my very incomplete Webflow experiment where I tried to follow my Sketch framework <a href="http://queeniwu.webflow.io/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br> Then, was the real deal. I typed out DOCTYPE! html and got to work. Utilizing bootstrap to introduce responsive web design, creating section ids to link to, and importing images, everything started to come together. Though forgetting semicolons and misspelled class names nipped at me constantly, it only made me want to work harder and harder. Because of refreshing and checking, my website became my most visited webpage on my browser within a matter of minutes.<br><br><br>




<h1>Step 5: The Conversation Piece</h1>
As I brought the graphics and the display together, I started sending my link to a couple of friends for feedback. Design is so collaborative, I knew there was no way to come out of this with an intriguing site without the help of others. <br><br>

A significant portion of people still thought the logo resembled a speech bubble, but only those who had seen the first iteration of the logo. Those that were seeing this for the first time immediately saw the Q. However, I still took that critique to action. <p style="color:white">a</p> <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/1d65f4d32da80771369a1fe5a3d7047b/tumblr_p5ozstgbu31t3a0hzo9_1280.png" alt="dev" height="45%" width="45%" align="left" style="margin: 5% 5% 6% 0%"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/1dfa44f380772e81ce31f1814b53bf06/tumblr_p5ozstgbu31t3a0hzo8_1280.png" alt="dev" height="45%" width="45%" align="right" style="margin: 6% 0% 5.772% 5%"><p style="color:white">a</p>  

As you can see from the picture of the two post-it notes during logo critique, I had an idea to use this flaw to my advantage. <i>What if I could impliment a conversation piece into this project?</i> I love talking anyway! One immediate change I made was to the greeting. I wanted to make entering my site more of an interaction. I wanted to create an atmosphere where it felt like the viewer was really meeting me and getting to know my work. "Welcome to my space" sounded like a gallery showing, rather, "Let's talk about design" was an invitation to connect. I also quickly edited the text in the contact box. If a conversation was ending, I'd want my viewer to keep in touch. <br><br>


Another piece that I wanted to add was an animated loading screen. Animations aren't just about looking cool and showcasing skill, but it should also be a way to communicate and influence the viewer. By bringing in the conversation piece, I wanted to focus on how that would look, and how that would connect to my personal logo and identity. Grabbing Sketch and Principle, I began to animate. <img src="https://github.com/queeniwu/portfolio/blob/master/speech.gif?raw=true" alt="dev" height="40%" width="40%" align="right" style="margin: 5% 0% 2.5% 5%">Though I was familiar with Principle's principles (haha get it?), making a speech bubble turn into a Q was much harder to create than I had imagined. Iterating the sketch file over and over, it was a hard but correct decition to make to greate a simpler loading screen - also reducing the amount of wait time for the viewer. In the end, to make sure the loading screen doesn't interfere with the viewers' experience, was shortened to just the typing bubble. <br><br> But scrolling through my website, I still didn't see how the conversation piece fit in. It had been a consious design decision to create a professional platform, <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/bf95e3586a5ce46e898853761ea6a836/tumblr_p61ym0iHsK1uhu4zwo4_r2_1280.png" alt="dev" height="40%" width="40%" align="right" style="margin: 2.5% 0% 5% 5%">but it seemed too stiff for someone who talked so much. At this point, I turned to information style and presentation for help. It was the environment I had to create that would foster the theme of my site and the way I present myself online. I restyled the headings to speech bubbles instead of a highlight through the center, and here I am, using voice-to-speech writing for the information on my site to create a natural conversational vibe. The goal was to put my identity out there for all to see, thus interaction and experience was at utmost importance, and things will always be reiterated as feedback comes in, again, creating that conversation around design. Plus, what is even design without conversation and collaboration?
<br><br>
With my site coded and content in, I wasn't a professional applicant without a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12GMQwZLPRXWNtP90WNDYhe6N6ar-Ow-K/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">resume</a>. I altered my previous resume to also include my new logo, and simplified my list of experiences to those that were relevant to my product design aspirations. Not to mention, I also created a business card that would make handing out my information much easier. I highlighted my website to center the attention around what I wanted to showcase.

My goal with this cohesive visual identity is to illicit a memorable application and identity when growing my professional profile. I want both my work and myself to come hand in hand, because after all, <b>if you don't live and breathe your work, switch careers.</b>


<br><br><br>

<h1>Step 6: There is No "Done"</h1>

In design, there is no such thing as being done. There will always be reasons to iterate, a change of goals, or a problem to solve, thus this portfolio will continue to morph as my ideas shift. That is my hope for myself as a designer as well. I hope to never stop growing, learning, and creating. This has only been the beginning of my creative journey, and I can't wait to have endless adventures full of colours.

<h1>QHacks 2018</h1>

<i>February 2nd-4th 2018 | Queen's University, Kingston ON</i><br><br>

In February, I entered my second hackathon with some wicked talented teammates from my school. We trekked our way to Kingston, ON for 36 hours of ideation and creation. This time, the four of us, Vivien, Patrick, Ali and I came with an idea, we wanted to utilize facial recognition to create a more secure smart home system.<br>
<img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/6d9f45a3b1e3bf91a78a38c6abd46cec/tumblr_p6olw3orBh1uhu4zwo3_r1_1280.png" alt="haven" height="50%" width="50%" align="left" style="margin:5% 0% 0% 0%">

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVNmqNaUMAEkcbO.jpg:large" alt="team" height="45%" width="45%" align="right" style="margin: 5% 0% 0% 5%">
<p style="color:white">a</p>

To get started we did some research on the dip of the smart home technology market. Users found the setup to be complicated, the devices expensive, and the services unsecure. Looking at these core values that the consumers had, we created a customer-to-customer platform for smart homes, similar to the way users develop iOS apps for users through the App Store. Instead of creating a single function, we ideated an entire systems of plausible functions. To make this a reality, we had to have a base system.<br><br>

We worked tirelessly to create an API using Python and Flask that learns the composition of someone's face through pictures. It is hosted using Amazon AWS and utilises libraries including OpenCV for image processing and OpenFace for face recognition. Then through frame by fram detection, unlocks and pulls personalized functions and settings in confidence of the facial recogniton. This allowed the curation of someone's perfect idea of "home" and transformed that into an experience.

On the user interface, created our user story on paper before proceeding to create graphics on Adobe Illustrator and screens on Sketch. They were then imported into Principle to create the guiding animations, and finally to create the user-centred software platform and to our smart technology. I was finally comfortable creating not only good looking, but <b>useful and purposeful animations</b> for the user interface.

<br>
Our hard work paid off! In the end, we were awarded <b>QHacks 2018 best hack using the Qualcomm Dragonboard</b> as presented by Mike Swift, CEO of Major League Hacking.

<h1>ConUHacks III</h1>

<i>January 28th-29th 2018 | Concordia University, Montreal QC</i><br><br>

Entering my first ever hackathon (in the beautiful city of Montreal), I had no idea what to excpect. I heard about all the cool tech that birthed from just the 24 hours available to the hackers, and to say I was intimidated was an understatement. My two teammates, Amy and Austin, were also hacking rookies. Despite our lack of knowlege, we didn’t lack excitement.<br> 


<img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/190a1f74cb036298dc8687ee175841f0/tumblr_p6olw3orBh1uhu4zwo2_r1_1280.png" alt="clarety" height="100%" width="100%" align="left" style="margin: 5% 5% 5% 0%">
One of the theme prompts was the wellbeing of the elderly population. We recognized that especially in the elderly population, physical health is often put in front of mental health. Thus, we wanted to focus on face to face support for those who live in loneliness. Because of our targeted users, a main topic that we ended up learning a lot about as well as applying was <b>accesibility.</b><br> <br>

After conducting as much user research as possible for a 24 hour hackathon, we concluded that a voice to text interface would be most useful and adaptable for a population where a large percentage are visually impared or suffer from hearing loss. This way, there were multiple senses available to communicate with this technology. Little did I know, voice interaction design was the most difficult form of interaction design possible. We spend the majority of the time ideating on the situations our users may be in and what phrases may be commonly used. Though tiresome, our process taught me a lot about voice interaction design and its complications. <br><br>

To get to building, we used Sketch to create the screens for the app, used Swift's iOS storyboard to create the user interface, and integrated it with IBM's Watson voice technology. We trained a female bot named Clare to respond appropriately to certain phrases regarding health concerns and contact commands, and voila, Clarety was born.

        Hey, I'm Queenie Wu, an aspiring product designer, ENTP, and a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.<br><br>
        
        As a kid, there were two distinct qualities about me. I had a crayon as my sixth finger, and the only word in my vocabulary was "why?". Though I've expanded to other creative mediums, I still posess the same curiosity for everything around me. My goal is to channel this energy into bridging the gap between organic thoughts and complex technology by creating ideal experiences for anyone through UIUX and product design.
        
 
         <br><br>
        Aside from meddling with pixels and palettes, I create <a href="http://www.queeniwu.tumblr.com" target="_blank">art</a>, coach and compete trampoline gymnastics, <a href="https://medium.com/@queeniwu" target="_blank">write about life</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafesandspaces/" target="_blank">eat everything</a> in my way.<br><br>
                 After a 4 month co-op as a digital product designer for Scotiabank, I'm currently searching for an internship for Fall 2018 (September-December). I hope to work with an exciting team with an everlasting appreciation for design, and a product I can get behind. For a complete list of my skills and experiences, check out my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12GMQwZLPRXWNtP90WNDYhe6N6ar-Ow-K/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">resume</a>!<br>
